#this flie will cover most of what you have learned in kali linux (commands)


touch: command will create empty file

tee: will create file then you can write on it then press ctrl + c

rm: -i delete file with confirm message

mv: rename file or change the directory of the file.

file: to determine a file's type.

state: give you info many about the file or the dirctory

test: related more to SC and usually used within a script.

cp copy contents of file to another file 

ps: process status (What's happing)

to use Linux as root use (sudo su#)

id: tells all about you

groups: to see all the groups the current user is part of it.

hostname: The host name 

passwd: TO change password

uname(-r -a...etc): It's very usefull, you can know about kernel name, network host, the vesion of your os (-v), the machine hardware name (-m) and more.

ifconfig -s: Network stuff

ip: more network stuff

netstat: The status of your network

ss: session stuff (similar to "netstat")

who: It tells you who currently loggend in. (man it!) 

env: enviroment variables

lsblk:list blocks hard drive stuff 

lsusb: are there is any usbs pugged in ?

lsof: this will list all the open files

man: it tells you about any command you want and description and 
how to use it etc...

you can use -h or --help after any command to get help 

aprops: it helps you to find the command that you want to use 

sudo adduser: to add user and remmember (adduser is better than useradd)

sudo userdel: to delete any user

visudo: is very dangerous

evry user have home and group (The group is the same name of the user)

sudo groupadd: to add a new group
 
no user have access to sudo only kali have this access.
so to add some users we can add group in the visudo file than
add users in this group.

to add user to group (sudo usermod -G user_name)...BUT WAIT!!

if you go with just -G you will eliminate this user from all other groups 
so to we will use (-aG)

to remove or delete user from a group use 
(sudo gpasswd -d user_name group_name)

to delete a group we use (sudo groupdel group_name)this will delete only 
the group

chmod: modify file access rights
su: temporarily become the superuser
sudo: temporarily become the superuser
chown: change file ownership
chgrp: change a file's group ownership


rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111
rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110
rwx --- --- = 111 000 000
and so on...
rwx = 7
rw- = 6
r-x = 5
r-- = 4


we can cahnge the owner of a file by using the "chown" command this
command is used like this:

> sudo chown (username) some_file

we can change the ownership of a file or directory may be changed with
"chgrp" this command is used like this:

> sudo chgrp new_group some_file


use ">" to print the output in file. for example ls > test_file will 
print the result in this file.
but if you use ">" again will delete the data inside this file 
so you have to use ">>" to add something and don't delete anything.


sort: is sorting data(numbers or words)use -h,-b,-f,...etc 
to see the power of this commend.

uniq: This is very useful command you can given a sorted stream of data 
from standard input, it removes udplicate lines of data(i.e.,it makes
sure that evert line is unique )

grep: This is very powerful command you can use it to seach for any word 
in any file(use -i to search for the word in UPPER and small cases, 
and you can use * to seach in multiple files)

fmt: It puts all words in a single line and prints on sidout.


you can display specific line in the file by many different ways:
	
#	head -x file_name | tail +x 
#	sed -n '10p' file_name
#	awk 'NR==4' file_name

if you want to delete file named(x.js and y.js) but you have some 
directories ends with the same end (c.js and d.js) so you can do this:

#	find . -type f(files) -name "*.js" -delete
usefull link:
	https://linuxhandbook.com/find-with-regex/
	
To display lines containing the pattern "root" and 4 lins after them in 
the file /etc/passwd:
	grep  -i "root" -A 3  /etc/passwd 
for before "" "" ""	-B
for after and before	-C

Display all the lines in the file /etc/passwd that do not contain 
the pattern “bin”:

	grep -i -v "bin" /etc/passwd

	   -v :  Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

to serach for empty folder or file use find command:

	find -type d(directories),f(files) -empty 

Delete Empty Files and Directories using Find Command:

	find -empty -type d,f -delete

if you want to know more about find visit this site:

	https://linuxhandbook.com/find-empty-directories/




The find exec is nothing but allows you to execute custom operations 
such as running scripts and executing programs on search results.

	-type f -empty -print0 -exec rm -v "{}" \;

And if you want to remove directories, the given command should work 
just fine:
	  -type d -empty -print0 -exec rmdir -v "{}" \;



xargs can take input from the standard input or even consider the output of 
another command as input and can use it as a command:
	
	cat ls_output | xargs du -h

printf : printf "Hello Mr. %s, your room number is %d. \n" 'Mohamed Khalid' 308
	or:
	printf "My brother %s is %d years old.\n" Mohamed 21

	 This is where printf command helps you. The bash printf command 
	operates like the printf command in C/C++ programming language.
	The first argument %s expects a string, %d expects a decimal 
	integer, just like C/C++. Don't worry if you are not familiar 
	with C/C++. 

sudo apt list : list packages based on package names
	 search : search in package descriptions 
you can learn more about apt just type:
	sudo apt -h

locate : is a Unix utility which serves to find files on filesystems.
It searches through a prebuilt local database of all files on the
filesystem generated by the "updatedb" command. Note it is essential to
update the database as recent files saved over a period of fewer than
24 hours are not updated into the database by default and the database
is updated once within 24 hours span.  


which : if you are wondering where exactly is a certain program is
located, simply use which on it. (try this with python or java) 
The which command locates an executable files in your shell's search
path.

Note that which only works on executable files. So you should use it 
only with the argument that you can run. For example, you install Java 
through the JDK package but you don’t run a command called ‘jdk’, you 
run ‘java’. So you use which command on java, not jdk.

If the which command doesn’t find the executable in the current path,
it returns nothing.

 find command is a more aggressive search tool than locate or which. 
Find is able to recursively search any given path for various files. 
Using the file command we can search for files by name, owner, group, 
permissions, type, size, time modified, date and various other 
criteria. The find command is highly efficient but this efficiency 
comes at a cost of time. (find be like: give me something about him and I will get his ass)

Here we will talk about Firewall so, LET'S DO IT :D


Here are the general steps to check your firewall settings using iptables:

sudo iptables -L

This will display a list of firewall rules, including the policy for 
each chain (e.g., ACCEPT, DROP, or REJECT).

You can also check the status of the firewall by running the 
following command:

sudo iptables -S


sudo ufw status

This will show the current staus of the firewall and  the list if 
allowed and blocked connections.

If you want to view the detailed information about your firewall 
settings, you can run the following command:

	sudo ufw show raw

This will display the raw configuration of your firewall in 
a human-readable format.

To modify the firewall settings, you can use the ufw command. For example, to allow incoming SSH connections, you can run the 
following command:

sudo ufw allow ssh

If the ufw command is not found, it's possible that the Uncomplicated 
Firewall package is not installed on your Linux system or is not 
supported by your distribution.

To check if ufw is installed, you can run the following command in 
your terminal:

which ufw

If the command returns nothing, it means that `ufw` is not installed on 
your system. In that case, you can install by this command:

sudo apt-get install ufw

so to enable the firewall and apply teh default set of rules that 
come whit `ufw`

After enabling `ufw` you can verify its status by running the 
following command:

sudo ufw status

This should show that the firewall is now active and the list of allowed 
and blocked connections.

Note that after enabling ufw, it's important to configure the firewall 
rules to allow the necessary traffic while blocking the unwanted traffic. 
You can refer to the ufw documentation for more information on configuring
the firewall rules.
