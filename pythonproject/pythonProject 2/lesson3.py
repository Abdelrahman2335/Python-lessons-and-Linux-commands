#Focus on this one:

# assert 5 > 3
# assert 5 == 5

#assert is checking if there is any logical errors

# for x in range(1,10):
#    if x > 5:
#        break
#    print(x)

# for x in range(1,8):
#     if x == 5:
#        continue
#     print(x)

#Import:

# import math

# from math import *

# print((cos(0)))

#x = 1
#y = 5
#def read1():
#    print(x)
#def write1():
#    global x
#    x = 2
#def write2():
#    print(y)

#her every thing is normal:

#read1()

##but her python started to read the change that global have made.

#write1()

#and when we try to see read1() as normal we found that the value have changed
#read1()

#write2()

#read1()

#It's like you are asking python

#a = [1,2,3,4,5]
#print(3 in a)
#print(3 not in a)

#(with) function let us write as and this will help you if your files have a long code

# with open("test","r+") as x:
#     print(x.read())
#     print(x.readable())
#     print(x.writable())
